# Rock-Paper-Scissors

This is a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game built using basic JavaScript. The game is played in the browser using the `prompt()` function to get the player's choice and the `console.log()` method to show results in the Developer Console.

## 🚀 How It Works

- The player is prompted to enter one of: `"rock"`, `"paper"`, or `"scissors"`.
- The computer randomly selects a choice.
- The game plays **5 rounds**, keeping track of who wins each round.
- After 5 rounds, the final winner is displayed based on the total scores.
